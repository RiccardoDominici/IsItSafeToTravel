- Average attempts per plan: ~2.2

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v3.0]: Baseline+signal tiered architecture — annual indices at 70%, realtime signals capped at 30%
- [v3.0]: Advisory sources are signal tier with 7-day half-life, 30-day max age
- [v3.0]: Advisory sub-weights in Conflict pillar: US 9%, UK 8%, CA 7%, AU 6%
- [v4.0]: New advisory sources must normalize to unified 1-4 level scale
- [v4.0]: Integration order: cleanup first, then API, HTML, complex, scoring, CI, docs, calibration
- [Phase 28]: Redistributed GDELT/WHO DONs weights proportionally among remaining indicators in v7.0.0
- [Phase 28]: Updated source count from 9 to 7 in all user-facing content after GDELT/WHO DONs removal
- [Phase 29]: UnifiedLevel 1-4 scale as standard for all advisory normalization
- [Phase 29]: Extended AdvisoryInfoMap type with de/nl/jp/sk keys for tier-1 sources
- [Phase 29]: Used static MOFA page ID to ISO3 mapping (120+ entries) for Japan advisory fetcher
- [Phase 30]: Extended dataDate extraction to work from any advisory source (base/tier1/tier2a)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Carry-over] Inline data embedding for comparison page needs monitoring (~1MB threshold at ~6 months of daily data)
- [v4.0] Rate limiting across 30+ advisory sources in CI — need staggered fetching
- [v4.0] Text-based advisories (Italy, Spain, China) may need LLM/NLP for level extraction
- [v4.0] Diverse level systems (3/4/5/6-level, color-coded) need normalization mapping
